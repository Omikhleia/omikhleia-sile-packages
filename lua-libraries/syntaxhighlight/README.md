Quick and dirty integration WARNING

The code here comes from [Leafo's Lua syntaxhighlight](https://github.com/leafo/lua-syntaxhighlight/),
a wrapper around the lexers from [Textadept](https://foicica.com/textadept/)
(2006-2020 Mitchell _et al._)

All of these are MIT-licensed.

The wrapper code was quickly modified (removal of the HTML conversion, changed to a table conversion
than can later be used in SILE)

On a technical viewpoint, this is all wrong likely to put that stuff here and hack it that way.
This is for a proof of concept, until a better solution is implemented.
