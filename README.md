Packages and classes for the SILE typesetter

I wanted to give a try to the [SILE](https://github.com/sile-typesetter/sile) typesetting system. If I had to typeset a book, however, the version of SILE at the time (that was 0.10.15 at the initial time of writing) lacked many supporting packages for the sort of things I usually write.

This repository is the result of my attempt at providing the packages and classes that would
fit my needs.

The [PDF documentation](./docs/omikhleia-packages.pdf) serves both as documentation and as
main showcase. A few other examples are provided too.
