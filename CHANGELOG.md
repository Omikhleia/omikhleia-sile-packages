## version 1.0.0 - June 23, 2022

After months of raw hacking, these classes and packages, which started as some
sort of experiment, have reached a decent state.

Of course, there are several areas that still need some work:
- By nature, everything in `packages/experimental/` is obsviously not guaranteed to be
  stable and iron-proof.
- Everything in `hacks/` must be considered with caution. There are mere
  workarounds, often partial, for issues reported to the SILE team, a few
  back-ports of fixes that got into SILE 0.13 or for which a PR exists.
- The **styles** package remains highly experimental, despite not being in
  that folder.

Yet, a decent-looking 362-page book was produced and published. The milestone thus
reached has to be marked! Also, from now on, I'll try to respect semantic versioning,
rather than the wild development we had here before.
