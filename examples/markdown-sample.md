# Markdown to SILE conversion with Pandoc {.unnumbered .justforfun}

::: {custom-style=EmphaticRight}
First version, June 2022.
:::

The source of this document is written in Markdown. A PDF may be generated with the following
instructions, provided "Omikhleia's classes & packages for SILE" are installed[^omikhleia-sile-packages].

```bash
pandoc -t pandoc/omimarkdown.lua examples/markdown-sample.md > examples/markdown-sample.sil; sile examples/markdown-sample.sil
```

[^omikhleia-sile-packages]: <https://github.com/Omikhleia/omikhleia-sile-packages>

## Introducing the challenge

Markdown processing with SILE has been, at least, an open question since 2016, if not even
earlier[^md-question].

At least three routes for converting Mardown to SILE can be considered, and are summarized
below. All these approaches have legitimate _pros_ and _cons_.
Be aware that the views presented here are somewhat opinionated!

[^md-question]: <https://github.com/sile-typesetter/sile/issues/413>

### Developing a native converter

The "native" way would be to interpret Mardown from SILE iteself.

This is what the SILE **markdown** class is trying to achieve, based on the Lua `lunamark` module for
parsing Mardown. As of March 2022, the results are still very unconvincing[^md-native]. It has lots
of bugs and is very incomplete.

The very idea of using SILE and Lua to process Markdown is not unsound. But besides its highly broken
_proof of concept_ status, the fact that this attempt comes as a _class_ is also questionable.
Class designers can implement lots of cool classes for books, articles, etc., but what does it tell
about including Mardown _content_ in a document based on these?

Would it be done another way, the _pros_ are that SILE would have its own logic, open for customization,
to process Markdown without the need of a third party solution. The _cons_ are that it requires
a good Markdown processing library, that has to be maintained, with a tight integration in SILE.

[^md-native]: <https://github.com/sile-typesetter/sile/issues/1336>

### Developing a Pandoc-based converter

Here, we refer to the standard Pandoc use, with that software providing a dedicated writer, 
likely written in Haskell and integrated in the software, as it does for other output formats.

Some efforts have been done in that direction. It requires a Pandoc fork[^md-pandoc-fork], which is
not yet (as of June 2022) merged upstream. It also requires the SILE **pandoc** package to be used, which has still plenty of `TODO` comments...

Again, the idea is not unsound. The apparent choice made in the current proprosal, though, is to
(more or less) expose the Pandoc AST to SILE, which would the implement then necessary actions.
This author does believe this approach to be kind of flawn --- There could have been ways for the
output to look more like it was written with the available tools and packages, rather than in weird
Pandoc low-level constructs that might change as the software evolves. Anyhow, would the Pandoc fork
be merged into the product, without any other effort in SILE itself, the result could be fairly
deceptive too, at this date, for reasons explained later.

Nothwithstanding the conversion output format, the _cons_, in my humble opinion, are that it
puts the burden of maintaining it on both the Pandoc and the SILE teams. The Pandoc AST is somewhat stable at this date, but changes are likely to be expected anyway. Relying on Pandoc's releases also means that getting things done is likely to take more time.

[^md-pandoc-fork]: <https://github.com/alerque/pandoc/commits/sile4>

### Developing a Pandoc "custom writer" in Lua

Pandoc, in the meantime, has evolved and it now supports creating custom "Writers"
in Lua[^pandoc-custom-writers].

While such custom writers may have some rough edges, the idea is quite appealing. After all,
SILE is mostly written in Lua, so the skills are there in the community. It has not
been considered until a recent date, though. As can be guessed from our introductory
note, it is the purpose of the present document to experiment and document that
third "route".

The _pros_ are that it is written in the same language as SILE and that it offers an
interesting alternative which doesn't imply modifications of Pandoc or a special build.
It also allows us to move fast, somewhat independently from Pandoc. The _cons_ is that
this custom writer API is fairly recent and might change. Actually, besides what is
called the "Classic style", there's now even a "New style"...

[^pandoc-custom-writers]: <https://pandoc.org/custom-writers.html>

## The proposed converter

After all this overlong introductory text, it's time to have a glance at the proposed
converter, written as a custom writer in Lua...
But, before proceeding further, let's also try to understand what may have failed in the
two first cases.

The main problem, in this author's opinion, is that they both tried something _without
having the necessary yet building blocks_ in SILE, and thus, without a clear design and
vision. Underline and strikethrough? Bullet lists and enumerations? Cross-references?
Tables? Code hightlighting? Custom styles? None of them were really available, and some
of these features are still missing from SILE's standard distribution, as of version
v0.12.5.[^building-blocks]

Lessons learnt[^md-lessons], I tried to proceed the other way round, first implementing
the building blocks found necessary, until _at last_ tackling with Markdown. And since
we now have this Pandoc "custom Lua writer" route, I went for it (using, for what is
worth, their "Classic" API).

Eventually, the SILE-native route might be preferable in the long term. However,
I do believe that one has to seek the low-hanging fruits first. Some of the choices
made here are therefore debatable[^debatable-choices], but in the end, the _user_
needs a solution that produces quality results. The internal implementation can change
later and be improved, one way or another. In other terms, I thrive for functionality
over an ideal implementation that might never be reachable.
What _end-users_ need is a working solution to process their Markdown content into
a neat PDF. That's one of the key point in _software adoption_ ---that is decently does
what you would expect, without having to dabble into obscure details[^obscure-details].

[^building-blocks]: This author has dabbled into bullet lists and enumerations, tables,
styling, cross-references, strikethrough, etc. with some proposals made to the
core distribution. I do not say this for "bragging", but rather to reinforce the
idea that when one gets all the building blocks available at hand, things then come
in a more natural fashion and the pieces of the puzzle start to assemble.

[^md-lessons]: The above comments might sound harsh to the individuals who made
the previous attempts. Let's not be unfair, though: their efforts paved the way
to the new attempt discussed here. Also, my own approach can be wrong too. It's
an [opinionated]{custom-style=Warning} viewpoint, after all!

[^debatable-choices]: E.g. syntax highlighting is currently based on a somehow
deprecated solution.

[^obscure-details]: I cannot even imagine the efforts that would be required
to fix the existing `lunamark`-based attempt and ensure it is good at supporting
all of the rich Pandoc-flavor of Markdown... As for installing a Pandoc fork,
this is pushing too much strain on the user, in my opinion.

## Supported elements

Obviously sectioning works.

### More or sectioning {-}

Unnumbered sections work too.

### Basic typesetting

Paragraphs are of course supported. Lorem ipsum dolor, sit amet consetetur, sadipscing elitr,
sed diam non umy eirmod tempor, invidunt ut labor.

As of formatting, *italic*, **bold**, and `monospace` all work as expected.

Unicode is supported. â˜º

Pandoc comes natively with smart typography: 3 dashes in Markdown are converted to an em-dash (---),
2 dashes to en en-dash for ranges (ex., "it's all in chapters 12--14"). Note that Pandoc also provides the necessary support for smart quotes and apostrophes. Three dots are converted to an ellipsis (...)

Just to test that text sequences that need to be escaped in SILE language are
properly managed, here is some text with %, \\ and { } characters.

A backslash or two spaces at the end of the line in the Markdown source\
force a line break.

Superscripted or subscripted text: H~2~O is a liquid, 2^10^ is 1024.

Some ~~deleted text~~, some [underlined text]{.underline},
and some [Small Caps]{.smallcaps}.

### Lists

#### Enumerations and bullet lists

Itemized list:

 * Item 1
 * Item 2

Numbered lists:

 1. First item
 1. Second item

List nesting:

 1. Item
     - Hello
        a. Hey
        b. Ho
     - World
 1. Item...

    ... With several paragraphs
     - Fruits
        - Apple
        - Orange
     - Vegetables
        - Carrot
        - Potato

    And here we go back to that item.

#### Task lists

- [ ] Unchecked item
- [x] Checked item

#### Numbered example lists

Also known as continuous lists.

(@)  First example
(@)  Second example

Some paragraph text...

(@)  Third example

(@good) Fourth example is good.

As the good example (@good) illustrates, numbered list work well.

#### Definition lists

Let's be honest, the current implemention is sort of a hack for now.

apples
  : Good for making applesauce.

oranges
  : Citrus!

### Block quotes

> Block quotes are
> written like so.
>
> They can span multiple paragraphs,
> if you like.
>
> > And can be nested.
>

More nesting...

> This is a block quote.
>
> 1. This is a list inside a block quote.
> 1. Second item.

### Line blocks

In "line blocks", this converter interprets the indentation as quad kerns.
For instance:

| Line one.
|  Line too.
|   Line three.
| Line four.

### Rules

An horizontal rule:

---

Just to check how it spans over the line, here is an orizontal rule in a block quote:

> ---
>
> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet

### Links and footnotes

Here is a link to [the SILE website](https://sile-typesetter.org/).

Here is link to a [section heading in the current document](#basic-typesetting) and
to [another](#tables-are-cool) with custom identifier

They might not be visible in the PDF output, but hover them and click. They work.

I am not sure yet what a link to a [local document](local-doc.md) should do.

Here's a footnote[^1].

[^1]: Some footnote text.

### Languages

Beside the global language setting in the [metadata preamble](#metadata-preamble),
language changes within the text are supported, either around blocks or inline
elements. It is is not much visible below, obviously, but the language setting
affects the hyphenation and other properties. In the case of French, for instance,
you can see the special thin space before the exclamation point.

::: {lang=fr}
> Cette citation est en franÃ§ais !
:::

Or inline in text: [Â«Encore du franÃ§ais!Â»]{lang=fr}

### Images

Here is an image: ![](./examples/sherlock.png "An exemplary image"){width=1cm}

An image has a legend if it stands on its own paragraph.

![Sherlock Holmes](./examples/sherlock.png "An exemplary image")

![](./examples/almaq/images/manicule.svg){height=0.6em} SVG is supported too.

You can specify the required image width and height, as done just above actually,
the SVG image being resized at `height=0.6em` --- Note that it accepts any unit
system supported by SILE.

![A "manicule" ornament](./examples/almaq/images/manicule.svg "An SVG image")

### Tables {#tables-are-cool}

Pandoc extends Markdown with several methods for declaring table. Obviously,
it's a question of input syntax, and the converter shouldn't have to bother.
Let us check anyway the generated tables look good in all cases.

### Simple table

  Right     Left     Center     Default
-------     ------ ----------   -------
     12     12        12            12
    123     123       123          123
      1     1          1             1

      1     1          1              1
-------     ------ ----------   -------

#### Multiline table

-------------------------------------------------------------
 Centered   Default           Right Left
  Header                    Aligned Aligned
----------- ------- --------------- -------------------------

                                    spans multiple lines.

  Second    row                 5.0 Here's another one. Note
                                    it also spans multiple
                                    lines.
-------------------------------------------------------------

Table: Here is the caption.\
It, too, may span multiple lines.

  Second    row                 5.0 Here's another one
                                    that also spans multiple

|    1  |    1 |     1   |     1  |

### Raw blocks

Raw blocks are Pandoc's way to pass native content to the underlying processor.
This converter therefore supports a `{=sile}` annotation on code blocks, to pass
through their content in SILE language, as shown below.

```{=sile}
For instance, this sentence is typeset in a \em{raw block}, in SILE language.
```

Likewise, on an inline content: `\em{idem.}`{=sile}

It also supports `{=sile-lua}` to pass Lua code, as in a SILE `\script`. This is just
a convenience compared to the preceding one, but it allows you to exactly type
its content as if it was in a code block (i.e. without having to bother wrapping
it in a script).

```{=sile-lua}
SILE.call("em", {}, { 'This' })
SILE.typesetter:typeset(" is called from Lua.")
```

### Code

Here's a Lua code sample:

```lua
SILE.registerCommand("section", function (options, content)
  -- Registering a sectioning command is as simple as that with
  -- our styles and sectioning packages.
  options.style = "sectioning:section"
  SILE.call("sectioning", options, content)
end, "Begin a new section.")
```

And a Python one:

~~~python
import time
# Quick, count to ten!
for i in range(10):
    # (but not *too* quick)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    print(i)
~~~

### Custom styles

The converter support the `{custom-style="..."}` syntax for custom styles.
If such a named style exists, it is applied.

Here is some line block marked as "Poetry":

::: {custom-style="Poetry"}
| I met a lady in the meads,
|  Full beautifulâ€”a faeryâ€™s child,
| Her hair was long, her foot was light,
|  And her eyes were wild.
:::

And some inline [message]{custom-style="Warning"}, marked as "Warning".

Obviously, these styles do not exist by default, so you have to provide a "style
declaration" in some external script, and ensure it is loaded when SILE processes
the document. Refer to the `scripts` entry in the [metadata preamble](#metadata-preamble).

### Bibliography citations

Support is minimal in this version. At some later stage, we may want to
consider using SILE's bibliography package... For now, the converter just
extracts the information and tries to present it decently.

Here is a "cite" [@Doe_2011, 67], another @Doe_2011 and
yet another [@Doe_2011, 67; @Smith_2012, 234--256].

### Metadata preamble

Pandoc provides various ways to specify document metadata (e.g., with a YAML metadata block).
This converter supports the following properties.

#### General properties

These document-wise properties are common with other converters:

 - `papersize`: defaults to "a4";
 - `lang`: a BCP 47 language identifier such as "en-US"; only the country code is used by SILE and defaults to "en";
 - `dir`: writing direction (either "ltr" or "rtl", ignored otherwise, and left absent if unspecified ---implying "ltr").

#### PDF metadata properties

These properties, also supported by several other converters, will here be used as PDF metadata.

 - `title`: a string;
 - `author`: a string or list;
 - `subject`: a string;
 - `keywords`: a string or list.

#### SILE-specific properties

SILE-specific formatting and layout settings are structured in a `sile` object property,
which can contain:

- `class`: the SILE class to use (for now, defaulting to `omibook`)
- `font-family`: the main font family, as a string or a list ---in the latter case, the
   additional fonts are declared as fallbacks for characters that would not be found in
   the main font;
- `font-size`: the main font size, as a number or string (which can refer to a SILE unit);
- `scripts`: a list of additional scripts that SILE will load after the main packages
   ---so that you can override some definitions, provide custom styles, etc.

There are several reasons for introducing a `sile` namespace, rather than using the same
options as other Pandoc writers (e.g. a `mainfont` entry, as used by HTML or LaTeX):

- To avoid cluttering inappropriate properties at a global level..
- To support more things than some writers (e.g. font fallbacks),
- To be able to select different settings for SILE and other writers (e.g. `documentclass` for LaTeX
  and `sile.class` have no reason to contain the same thing... That could occur for very basic
  class names which are likely to exist in both solutions ---say, perhaps "book"--- but that's all);
- To avoid the mess with the loose _ad hoc_ properties from some other writers (e.g. LaTeX's `monofont`,
 `sansfont`, etc. are somewhat ill-designed). We use the class and style paradigms with more elegance.

## Unsupported elements

### Math equations

Inline math equation: $\omega = d\phi / dt$.
Display math should get its own line like so:

$$I = \int \rho R^{2} dV$$

### Extensions and other features...

Several topics are left to a later version of this converter:

- Pandoc templates, so we can make some Pandoc CLI options work, such as `-s` (standalone), `--toc`, etc.
- "Standalone mode" will actually be necessary to better control some features, e.g. metatada etc.
  should not be overridden is the output is intended to be used not as a standalone document but as
  an include file in some other document.
- Table of contents (and probably too, lists of figures/tables).
- Paragraph indents. The converter currently sets `\neverindent`. Paragraph skips too should
  probably be addressed. There are some (small but annoying) challenges there, so we went on
  without them ---it's all about reaching the low-hanging fruits again, see _supra_.

## Towards a conclusion?

::: {custom-style=FramedPara}
This is but a quick proof of concept...

So, what should we do now?
:::

If you read so far, it's maybe up to you, my gentle reader, to provide feedback
and help pushing this experiment farther.
