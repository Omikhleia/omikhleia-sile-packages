Where to start this document about colophons and paragraph shaping? Galileo, in 1638, wrote:

\font[size=9pt]{%
\colophon{%
The area of a circle is a mean proportional
between any two regular and similar polygons of which one
circumscribes it and the other is isoperimetric with it.
In addition, the area of the circle is less than that of any
circumscribed polygon and greater than that of any
isoperimetric polygon. And further, of these
circumscribed polygons, the one that has the greater number of sides
has a smaller area than the one that has a lesser number;
but, on the other hand, the isoperimetric polygon that
has the greater number of sides is the larger.}}

It looks cool, perhaps, but typesetting text in a circle, however, is difficult.
The first and last lines do not have much place to play with. Even with
hyphenation, one is no guaranteed that the text can be broken at appropriate
places. And one cannot be sure the last line, anyway, by nature incomplete,
can fit well in a circle. What if, morevover, one wants to display some sort of
ornament around a circular-shaped paragraph, not knowing beforehand how it will
look? Spaces in a line can be streched or shrinked. Let us try and debug:

\colophon[decoration=true,figure=debug]{\lorem{}.}

This is not too bad, is it?

Quoting Wikipedia, a colophon (/ˈkɒləfon/) is a brief statement containing information about
the publication of a book such as the place of publication, the publisher, and the date of publication.
Colophons are usually printed at the ends of books. The term colophon derives from the Late Latin \em{colophōn},
from the Greek \em{κολοφών} (meaning “summit” or “finishing touch”). The existence of colophons can be dated back
to antiquity.

It is quite common for colophons to be surrounded by some sort of ornament. While regular paragraphs
are composed of square-shaped blocks, colophons may take various shapes. Can we automated their
presentation with SILE in a successful way? Honestly, the ways to do so can be fragile, with a lot
of underlying assumptions, and sometimes some manual “tweaks” may be needed. Let us quote Franz
Kafka, from his \em{Diaries}, 1910–1923:

\font[size=9pt]{%
\colophon[decoration=true]{%
The life of society moves in a circle. \em{Only those burdened with a common affliction understand each other}.
Thanks to their affliction they constitute a circle and provide each other mutual support. They glide along
the inner borders of their circle, make way for or jostle one another gently in the crowd. Each encourages
the other in the hope that it will react upon himself, or –and then it is done passionately– in the immediate
enjoyment of this reaction. Each has only that experience which his affliction grants him; nevertheless one
hears such comrades exchanging immensely varying experiences. ‘This is how you are,’ one says to the other;
‘instead of complaining, thank God that this is how you are, for if this were not how you are, you would have
this or that misfortune, this or that shame.’ How does this man know that? After all, he belongs –his statement
betrays it –to the same circle as does the one to whom he spoke; he stands in the same need of comfort.}}

It still looks decent? Obviously, any long text has more chances to look fine when shaped into a circle.
This type of colophon might not be appropriate for short statements.

The editor wishes to thank all the the authors, reviewers

designed the layout & provided helpful hints on how
best to present these essays to our audience; Peter Font is an
experimented proofreader, with an acute eye up to the

the project from its inception to its end. She
cannot be thanked enough for all her efforts in such
a small colophon.}}

Chief Black Elk was wise. He had someting to say regarding circles.

\font[size=9pt]{%
\colophon[decoration=true,figure=elegant,ratio=1.02]{%
“Everything an Indian does is in a circle, and that is because the power of the World always
works in circles, and everything tries to be round (…) The sky is round and I have heard the
earth is round like a ball, and so are all the stars. The wind in its greatest power whirls,
birds make their nest in circles, for theirs is the same religion as ours. The sun comes forth
and goes down again in a circle. The moon does the same and both are round. Even the seasons
form a great circle in their changing, and always come back again to where they were. Our teepees
were round like the nests of birds. And they were always set in a circle, the nation’s hoop.”}}

An expressive colophon, now.

As Franz Kafka wrote in \em{Josephine the Singer, or the Mouse Folk}…

\font[size=8pt]{%
\colophon[decoration=true,figure=cornered]{%
Cracking a nut is really not an art form, and so no one will dare to call an audience
together and entertain it by cracking nuts. If he does it nevertheless, and does
so successfully, then it must be a matter of something more than merely cracking nuts.
Or it is cracking nuts, but we must have ignored some aspect of this art form because
we mastered it too well and it took this new nutcracker to reveal its true nature to us,
and it can even help its demonstration if he is a little less proficient at nutcracking than
the rest of us.

And thus, we have finished.
